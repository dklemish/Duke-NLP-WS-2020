    "In Notebook 4A, we built a sentiment analysis model for movie reviews.\n",
    "That particular sentiment analysis was a two-class classification problem, where the two classes were whether the review was positive or negative.\n",
    "Of course, natural language comes in all sorts of different forms; sometimes we want to perform other types of classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the AG News dataset contains text from 127600 online news articles, from 4 different categories: World, Sports, Business, and Science/Technology.\n",
    "AG News is typically used for topic classification: given an unseen news article, we're interested in predicting the topic.\n",
    "For this assignment, you'll be training several models on the AG News dataset.\n",
    "Unlike the quick example we trained in Notebook 4A, however, we're going to *learn* the word embeddings.\n",
